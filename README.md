#Fun with React + Redux

Updating a monolithic JS + d3 game to use React and Redux.

## Step 1: Build config

Tools: Webpack, Babel, various plugins.

I wanted to get going with some of webpack's great features like hot reloading without a complex
configuration. There are many great react and redux starter kits ( like [here](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit), [here](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit), [here](https://github.com/erikras/react-redux-universal-hot-example), and [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app))
